# Per Scholas Lab 320.1 React Page Layout

I added some functionalities like the searching, learned recently and implemented in class. I added the appropriate styling (without images) and added some of my own. 
[Demo](https://jordles.github.io/Per-Scholas-Lab-320.1/)

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
